# 007: Happy Numbers

Date: 07/07/2025
Check wether a number is happy or not.
A happy number is defined by the following process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of its squares digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
If it ends in 1, then the number is happy. If it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1, then the number is not happy.
