Date: 29/06/2025
You have coins worth 1, 5, 10, 25, 100 and 500. You need to make various amounts of money using as many 500s, then 100s, and so on down.
For instance, for 468, you need 4x100, 2x25, 1x10, 1x5 and 3x1, for a total of 11 coins.
Write a function that returns the total amount of coins needed, and how many of each coin is used.
